# Feed Reader Testing project | Project 4 | Fron-End Web Development

This is my repository for Udacity's  project#4 using Udacity starter code (forked from udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)).

## Development Strategy

For a refresher (or reference) before you begin writing code, we recommend reviewing the content from [JavaScript Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549). Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Feed Reader Testing project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view). Please review for detailed project requirements.

1. Familiarize yourself with the starter code
    * Open up `index.html` and review the functionality of the application within your browser
    * What is all the code in `app.js` doing? Be sure to read all code comments
    * Check out `style.css`. How is styling applied to the application?
2. Explore the Jasmine spec file in `feedreader.js`
    * This is the file in which you'll be writing your tests
    * Make sure to read all code comments here as well
    * Review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io) if needed
3. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in `app.js` to make the provided test fail
    * See how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application
    * Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state after reviewing the failed test
4. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined _and_ that the URL is not empty
    * For example, how would you use a `for...of` loop in this test?
5. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What are you testing for this time?
6. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
7. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default
    * You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how the hiding/showing of the menu element is implemented
    * What code in `app.js` is directly involved with toggling the menu on and off?
8. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What is different this time around?
    * Which clickable element are you checking for?
    * How do you "simulate" a mouse click that element without actually clicking it?
9. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
10. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container
    * How does Jasmine's `beforeEach()`function work?
    * How does the `loadFeed()` function in `app.js` work? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
11. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
12. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes
    * How is this test different from the previous test?

Additionally, note that:

 * No test should be dependent on the results of another
 * Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
 * Error handling should be implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
 * When complete, all of your tests should pass
